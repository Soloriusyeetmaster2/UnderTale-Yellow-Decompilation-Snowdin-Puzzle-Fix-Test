# UnderTale Yellow Decompilation
A Decompilation of UnderTale Yellow v1.1

GameMaker Version used: 2023.4.0.84

GMLive is present in the project, but is still currently using Decompiled Code, which isn't the best
> This will probably not be changed, as it's not really a problem, and I dont use GMLive

scr_enums contains all Enum Declarations for the Project

It currently still uses UnderAnalyzer's Stock Enums, but it still works, so...

### CURRENT ISSUES!

- rm_dunes_30_old and rm_dunes_30 are MISSING, since they didn't decompile right
> rm_dunes_30 is being faithfully recreated, but rm_dunes_30_old won't and will remain empty, because its unused

- (in rm_snowdin_19_yellow) Second IceCube Puzzle in Snowdin is fucked up due to the pistons having a pretty
big collsion box
> it is beatable, but it is still scuffed
