UnderTale Yellow Decompilation by burnedpopcorn180
(another one to add to the list)

GameMaker Version used: 2023.4.0.84

GMLive is present in the project, but is still currently using Decompiled Code, which isn't the best
This will probably not be changed, as it's not really a problem, and I dont use GMLive

scr_enums contains all Enum Declarations for the Project
It currently still uses UnderAnalyzer's Stock Enums, but it still works, so...

CURRENT ISSUES!

rm_dunes_30_old and rm_dunes_30 are MISSING, since they didn't decompile right
(rm_snowdin_19_yellow) Second IceCube Puzzle in Snowdin causes a Crash (obj_molten_rock_snowdin_19)
