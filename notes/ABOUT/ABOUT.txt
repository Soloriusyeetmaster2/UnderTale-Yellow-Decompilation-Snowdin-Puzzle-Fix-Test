UnderTale Yellow Decompilation by burnedpopcorn180
(another one to add to the list)

GameMaker Version used: 2023.4.0.84

GMLive is present in the project, but is still currently using Decompiled Code, which isn't the best
This will probably not be changed, as it's not really a problem, and I dont use GMLive

scr_enums contains all Enum Declarations for the Project
It currently still uses UnderAnalyzer's Stock Enums, but it still works, so...

BIG ISSUES!

Steamworks SoftLock near when showing Axis the shitbot you built
(rm_steamworks_22) (obj_steamworks_22_controller_pacifist)


SMALL ISSUES!

rm_dunes_30_old and rm_dunes_30 are MISSING, since they didn't decompile right
rm_dunes_30 has been """"faithfully"""" recreated from scratch in order to progress, but still, not the original

Some Snowdin Rooms have Tiles that are incorrectly placed
(Purely Visual Issue)

(rm_snowdin_19_yellow) Second IceCube Puzzle in Snowdin is fucked due to the pistons having a very
big collsion box

spr_snowdin_19_piston had its collison box flattened to make it possible to beat, but its a bad fix
change it back to automatic when fixed

Also, For any Physics Objects that crash, check if room enables pyhsics
